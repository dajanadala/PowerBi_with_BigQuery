# AdventureWorks-DB-first project-with-BigQuery-and-PowerBI

Welcome to my first project with PowerBi. 

## Project Overview 
This project aims to provide insights and visualizations into the AdventureWorks database.

The AdventureWorks database contains data related to a fictitious bicycle manufacturer, including information on products, sales, customers, and employees. In this project, I will use Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize the data in order to gain a better understanding of the business operations of AdventureWorks. 

The first two pages of my project are practice visuals. The next two pages are part of the project presentation.
I have provided separate files for Bigquery queries used to extract data.

## Requirements 
* Query Editing Tool - Microsoft BigQuery
* Visualization Tool - Microsoft PowerBI (free version)


## Sample Questions Answers:
##### 1. How, on a very general level, should dashboards be structured? What information should be provided at the top of the dashboard vs information provided at the bottom?
General Structure of Dashboards:
The most critical metrics or KPIs at the top of the dashboard.
They should be immediately visible to provide a quick overview of performance or status.
In the middle: summary charts or graphs that provide insights into trends, comparisons, and patterns.
These visual summaries might support the KPIs and offer a deeper understanding at a glance.
Interactive Elements can be on the side or in the visuals:
Filters, drop-down menus, and sliders enable users to customize the view or drill down into specific data segments.
Suggestions for bottom of the dashboard might include footnotes, data sources, definitions, and other explanatory information that is secondary to the main purpose of the dashboard.


##### ii. Why is providing preattentive attributes important when constructing dashboards?
Importance of Preattentive Attributes:
Preattentive attributes are visual properties like color, size, orientation, and motion that the human brain notices without conscious effort. Their importance in dashboard design includes:
Efficiency: They allow users to quickly grasp important data points or changes without having to read through text or compare numbers.
Emphasis: They can highlight critical data or deviations from expected patterns, drawing the userâ€™s attention where it is most needed.
Organization: They can group or segment data visually, making complex information more digestible.
Identification: They can be used to create visual cues for navigating the dashboard and understanding the data hierarchy.

##### iii. Can you think of situations where having a less interactive dashboard is more suitable than having a heavily customizable interactive dashboard?  
Situations for Less Interactive Dashboards:
A less interactive dashboard may be more suitable in the following situations:
Display Screens: When dashboards are displayed on public screens or in common areas where interaction is not possible.
Executive Summaries: High-level stakeholders often need a snapshot without the desire or time to interact deeply with data.
Printed Reports: If the dashboard needs to be printable, interactivity is not practical.
Resource Constraints: Interactive features require more computing power and development time. In resource-limited environments, a simple dashboard may be more cost-effective.
User Experience: For users who are not tech-savvy, too much interactivity can be overwhelming and hinder the understanding of the information presented.
